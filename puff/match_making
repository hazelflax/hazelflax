Like anything else, effective match making may require a lot of experience, but how can experienced match makers be incentivized to advise matches that may outlive them?
They could be paid with a (transferrable) contract that eventually pays based on the success of the match.  If the matchmaker wants liquidity, he can sell the obligation (perhaps to another match maker).
