People seem to think that in non-swing ï¼ˆI.e. safe) states, one's vote so unlikely to influence the outcome that it's not worth the bother.
But how do you know if it would be a swing state if everyone who was discouraged by the results voted anyway?  Maybe it's only "safe" because people think it's "safe".  Maybe people have different thresholds at which they consider it to be too safe to bother, s.t. your vote could trigger a cascade.  Maybe it won't be safe if people read this essay. 
How often do states flip that were considered safe?  Is the notion of safety empirical or is it just a manifestation of the lucid falacy?
(Maybe we shouldn't consider a state to be safe just because of election results.)
