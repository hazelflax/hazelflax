The multi-hazelflax cross-representation conjecture

(Prerequisite: Unsupervised multi-objective rationality)

Suppose some different utility functions (in multi-hazelflax) have only trivial differences.  Since each utility function is associated with a spearate policy, will equilibria be eliminated those utiliy functions being the same and having one policy? Will extra equilibria (due to policies essentially being divided) be eliminated? E.g. by choosing an equilibrium on the Pareto frontier?
(I'm not sure there's a simple way of choosing among equilibria that will be widely agreed upon.)
What about in the original hazelflax? I.e. will agents with different code that implements the same objective act as one (even tho policies are chosen assuming only agents with the exact same code follow the policy)? (I.e. can agents with diferent code predict each other's behavior sufficiently to coordinate (without the infinite regress entailed by them simply running each other)?
{The hazelflax is just a definition of optimal behavior.  A nieve agent implementation may not terminate, however a programs that acts (more or less) rationally for an objective may be shown to approximate the hazelflax.  E.g. a multi-hazelflax like algorithm may score highly as a hazelflax approximation. }
